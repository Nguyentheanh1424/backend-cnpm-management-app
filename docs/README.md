# Project Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the backend CNPM management application. The documentation is organized by component type to make it easy to find information about specific parts of the application.

## Directory Structure

- **[controllers/](controllers/index.md)** - Documentation for all controller files, which handle HTTP requests and business logic
- **[utils/](utils/index.md)** - Documentation for utility functions and helper modules
- **modules/** - Documentation for data models and database schemas (to be added)
- **middlewares/** - Documentation for middleware functions (to be added)

## Purpose

This documentation serves several purposes:

1. **Code Understanding** - Provides clear explanations of how each component works without having to read through the code
2. **Onboarding** - Helps new developers quickly understand the project structure and functionality
3. **Maintenance** - Makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase by providing a reference for how components should work
4. **API Reference** - Serves as a reference for the API endpoints and their expected behavior

## Contribution

When adding new features or modifying existing ones, please update the corresponding documentation files to keep them in sync with the code.
